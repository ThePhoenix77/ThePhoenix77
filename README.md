Hi, I'm **Taha**

I’m a **Computer Science graduate** from the enchanting lands of **Morocco**, where the sun sets over the mountains and meets the sea.

Passionate about solving complex problems, where **C++** is my go-to when it comes to crafting digital wonders.

When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll find me **casting my lines** over the sea waves 🎣🌊 or diving into a deep **chess** match ♟️, always looking for ways to unwind and seek peace of mind.

Currently diving into the world of **SE**, **ML** and **AI**🤖.
