Hi there, I'm Taha!

Iâ€™m interested in programming languages and competitive programming.

Currently, I'm pursuing my education at  [1337 Khouribga](https://1337.ma/en/khouribga/). 

My world revolves around the thrill of coding, the fascination of learning new languages, the excitement of 
competitive programming, playing chess and the tranquility of fishing. C++ is my language of choice when it comes to crafting digital wonders.
